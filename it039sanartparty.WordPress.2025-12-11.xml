<h2>Where to Begin</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like most side hustle stories, I was looking for a way to bring in some extra income. I wanted something that would be fun and engaging since I knew I would have to work on it in my spare time. I needed a business that would align with my passions and talents to carry me through after a long day of work, family, and life. I soon found that I got a second wind when I worked to put parties together at night (sometimes until midnight) because it came easily and I enjoyed it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I love this quote from Lori Greiner, “Entrepreneurs are willing to work 80 hours to avoid working 40 hours a week". I didn't know if this business would ever allow me to replace a 40-hour-a-week desk job, but I was willing to at least see if I could add some extra monthly income doing something rewarding that I enjoyed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, my criteria included working with children, creating art projects, and using my background in administration and organization with a focus on a service-based business. These things were all clues when I thought about what kind of business to start and it was confirmed when I found the time would fly when I spoke to potential customers, or while I prepped for a party. In other words, pick something you can immerse yourself into that comes (almost) effortlessly! </p>

<h2>Kids + Art + Birthdays</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Birthday parties can be stressful! (This is another reason why I chose this <a href="https://www.itsanartparty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art party business</a>. Stressed-out parents are looking for a fun, unique, memorable experience for their kids and friends that won't break the bank.) I wanted to help people see that art doesn't have to be intimidating or overwhelming and you CAN create art projects at home with a bunch of rowdy kids! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the goal of the consultation call is to make my clients feel comfortable bringing me (and my art supplies) into their homes. Part of the satisfaction comes in the genuine appreciation from my clients after they realize they barely lifted a finger to pull off an art party (of course, they still had to provide me with a guest list and take care of the cake and decorations, but those things are relatively easy compared to entertaining a group of kids). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Websites and Locations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as you start dreaming about booking parties, you'll need a website so people can find you. Of course, there are lots of options when it comes to birthday parties. How can you and your business stand out from the crowd? There will always be people who will want to have their party any place OTHER than their home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why I also made sure people knew they could rent out a park pavilion or even book a section of a restaurant and I would still come to them. Backyard parties are also easy and low-cost (weather permitting, of course) because it takes some of the pressure off of having the art party indoors. But let's get back to the website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are so many easy ways to create a website that there really isn't an excuse not to have one. As soon as you set up a site, you'll be able to start directing people to visit your party page to learn more about your services. Even just printing up a handful of business cards and leaving them on park bulletin boards, ice cream shop counters, or at swim schools (with permission from the owner) can be a quick way to start generating leads. Social media and word of mouth would be next, followed by some easy SEO on your website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Supplies and Preparation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to art supplies, you will want to find good quality supplies that won't cut too much into your profit margin. I always select cotton-wrapped canvases that kids can take home and easily hang on their walls. They are durable and hold up well to marker and paint. Speaking of paint, this is probably one of the harder supplies to decide upon. While acrylic paint is permanent once it dries, it is also vibrant and covers the canvas well. Tempera paint may be washable, but I never liked the chalky feeling and limited color options. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mixing paint doesn't appeal to me because it takes time and can be a huge waste of paint if you don't do it right. Watercolors are a lot of fun, but not for canvas. Once I decided on canvases and acrylic paint, I never looked back. Sure I had some people who were terrified of having paint in their homes, but I would always suggest moving the party outdoors or into the garage. Come to think of it, I have probably done more garage parties than outdoor parties. Not only do you get the shade from being in the garage, but you have a concrete floor to easily clean up spills. There are so many options!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preparing for a party takes about as much time as facilitating the party itself. This is because I custom create each canvas design based on the client. That being said, I reuse my templates for other parties which saves time down the road and my portfolio of designs is always expanding. I encourage people to tell me what the birthday boy or girl is really interested in and I will try to come up with a design around their interests. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, unicorns and mermaids are popular designs for girls, but sometimes clients want something really custom and would ask me to draw their family pet. I could always use the unicorn template again, but I might not get a chance to reuse a family pet. In those cases, I would still hold onto the template just in case another opportunity for that kind of pet came up and I could offer it as a suggestion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you know the design, you can start working on your canvases. I give my clients a deadline to get the final headcount back to me within 48 hours of the party. Once I know how many canvases to prepare, I get to work. I have found that outlining the design with a black Sharpie marker helps the kids to enjoy painting. A blank canvas or a thinly drawn pencil line feels intimidating to some children. Knowing what and where to paint makes the party run more smoothly (after all, it's a party and not an art class). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My templates are drawn on plain paper (or sometimes poster board if you have a design you are using often). I then use any bright light source I can find and put the template behind the canvas (light boards, windows during the day, or the top of a lamp at night). I started tracing them with a pencil first and going over them with a Sharpie, but that doubles my workload. As long as I could easily see my template and made sure it didn't shift, I worked my way up to being confident enough to only use the Sharpie. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additional supplies include paint brushes, water cups, disposable table covers, paper towels, pencils or pens to write names on the back of the canvases, and paper plates for the paint. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Set-Up and Clean-Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A big part of making my clients feel comfortable with an art party is assuring them that I will perform all the set-up and clean-up of art supplies. They will only need to provide the tables, a trash can, and a water source or sink. Chairs are optional because the kids can stand around the table (this is great for outdoor parties or pool/art parties when kids are soaking wet but still want to paint!). Sometimes clients will want to use their own table covers to match the party colors or decorations. As long as it's a disposable cover, the next thing you will need to do is set up the supplies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each place setting includes a canvas, paint brushes, paper towels, paint (shared with a neighbor or two), and a water cup. It takes about 15 minutes to greet your client and set up the supplies. I usually tell the client I will arrive 15-20 minutes before the party guests arrive so I can complete the setup with limited interruptions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the kids are done painting, clean-up takes about another 10-15 minutes. I use disposable paper plates for the paint because I can't save it for another party anyway and it's easy to dispose of. Brushes can be washed out quickly (or taken home to wash out) along with the cups. You can leave the canvases on the table to dry or move them to a sunny spot to maximize the drying time before the kids take them home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes clients will need to use the tables for food and cake so I do everything I can to offer my help with getting them ready for the next party activity. My goal is to serve the client with a helpful attitude in all situations (especially since most parties are drop-offs and the client doesn't have much help aside from me).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Follow-Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a successful party, check back with the client by email to thank them for choosing you and make sure they were satisfied with the party. If you receive a good response, send them a link to leave you a review on social media. Genuine reviews can provide a major boost to your reputation. Not only do you want to do a good job, but you will want them to tell others that you did a good job. You can also leave them with a few business cards to pass out to their friends or insert them into the back of the canvas for kids to take them home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that's it! Time to take some more consultation calls and get back to work. This really is a rewarding business because you're walking into a party atmosphere and bringing the creative aspect to reinforce the fun of art to kids of all ages. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wish you all the best with your business endeavor and hope you'll find preparing and facilitating art parties as fun as I do!</p>

<p>When it comes to kid's birthday parties, the possibilities are just about endless. From invitations to decorations, locations to cakes, guest lists to entertainment, it can be overwhelming (not to mention themes and party favors)! If you've planned a birthday party in the last decade, you get it. Parties are getting more entertaining (and more expensive) all the time. How can you create a party that your kids will remember, without breaking the bank (or losing your sanity)? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most kids like to be creative and want to try something different. Even if you don't consider <em>yourself</em> an artist, I have cost-effective and easy-to-implement solutions for you! You CAN host a paint party at home. Let's get started! </p>

<h2>Step 1: Choose A Painting Party Location </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know the combination of art and kids in your home can feel chaotic and stressful. Rest assured, there are ways to lessen any potential mess while pulling off a professional-looking party. Once you decide to have the party at home, think about the best location. Do you have a backyard with some shade or a basement? What about your garage? If you take the cars out, is there room to set up 1-2 folding tables? A shaded driveway will also work. If it's the middle of winter, do you have a neighborhood clubhouse? Those folding tables are also useful on top of a disposable plastic table cover on tile or a hard floor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people have at least one place to set up tables inside or outside. If all you have is a dining room table on carpet, we can work with that too! Use a few disposable table covers for the floor and another one for the table. Pay attention to any spills and clean them up right away so they aren't tracked around the rest of your house. Kids who are done painting can wash up and move on to eating a snack or playing with some toys in the next room. Suggest to parents that they stay during the painting time if they want to drop off their kids.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my art party business, I have done parties in each of these locations. Each party is different, but the setup and thoughtful planning are always the same. I tell my clients that all I need from them is a trash can and access to a sink. It takes about 10 minutes to set up and 10 minutes to clean up. Time is really spent in preparation which we will talk about in the following steps to hosting your own art party at home.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 2: Decide On A Paint Party Theme</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While an art party is a theme in itself, exactly <strong>what</strong> are the kids going to paint? Giving kids a blank canvas and some paint usually doesn't work very well in a party setting. It's much better to coordinate something for them to paint ahead of time so they aren't struggling to come up with a picture themselves or feeling lost and getting discouraged. Remember that you are planning a party, not an art class!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A theme can be anything that the birthday boy or girl likes (or even the first initial of each child's name). Sometimes it's easy to find decorations first and then come up with a design for your painting. If the stores are completely out of unicorn supplies, then maybe a princess theme with tiaras and scepters will work. You can even choose a theme based on food like ice cream or animals like butterflies or dinosaurs. If they really want a specific movie character, then run with that for the decorations and pick an aspect of that character to paint. Spiderman might be all they are interested in, but you can have them paint rectangular buildings and a spider web. Pre-drawing the outline of the design is a major part of planning the party that we will talk about in step 4. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 3: Art Party Supplies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's talk art supplies! Again, there are lots of possibilities here. In my experience, back stapled cotton canvases make a great impression and give your party guests something to take home for an all-in-one party favor. They also have a great spot on the back for writing names and dates and can easily be hung on a wall with only one nail. I use 10" x 10" canvases because they are just the right size for painting on tables and small enough to carry home. You can usually find these in value packs of 8 or 12 at art supply stores. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paint choices on canvas really come down to tempera or acrylic and there are pros and cons to both. Tempera paint is washable, but I find it to be chalky and not as vibrant as acrylic paint. You may not be able to find as many colors with tempera and mixing paint can be a huge waste of time (and paint if you don't get the colors right). It can also be very thin and doesn't coat the canvas as well. As you can tell, my only pro for tempera paint is washability. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acrylic paint is washable when wet, but may be permanent once it dries. The number one solution to this for clothes is to provide your guests with smocks or make sure parents know to dress kids in clothes that may get paint on them. You can also suggest that they bring an adult extra-large old shirt with them to the party to put on over their clothes while they are painting (or buy a pack of those to have on hand. They might even be cheaper than buying artist smocks).   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acrylic paint is also easy to find and comes in a wide variety of colors. Some acrylic paint like gold, silver, or copper has some shimmer to it which is great for adding shine without the mess of glitter. I have also used colors like metallic teal. These are always crowd pleasers! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other supplies you will need include paintbrushes, disposable table covers like we talked about in step 1, small paper plates, paper towels, pencils, Sharpie markers, and disposable cups for water. Paintbrushes can be assorted in size and sometimes come in packs of 25 or 50. I offer two sizes to each child; a larger paintbrush for the background and a smaller one for details. I use the paper plates as palettes. You won't be able to save the paint, so the plates can easily be thrown away. If you are feeling ambitious, you can get some plastic palettes. Just know that these are time-consuming to wash. You could also use empty yogurt containers or other plastic containers for water cups and save the disposable cups for drinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 4: Pre-Drawn Canvas Designs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you select a theme and have your supplies, you're ready to start preparing the canvases for the day of the party. It's important to know how many guests you are expecting and prepare one extra canvas in case a sibling of one of your guests shows up unannounced or a canvas accidentally gets ruined. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your party theme and decide on a design. You can search the internet for ideas or come up with something as simple as a heart or cupcake. Using a blank piece of printer paper, draw or trace your design. Outline it in black Sharpie marker and then cut around it leaving a border around the marker outline. This will be your template.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find a strong light source and place the paper template on the back side of the canvas. You may want to gently tape the template to the back of the canvas so it doesn't shift while you are tracing it. You could buy a light tracing board or box, but the free option is to use a window or the top of a table lamp. By holding the canvas up to the window or the lamp over the lightbulb, you should be able to easily see your template and trace it with a pencil or Sharpie onto the canvas. A pencil is an ok option if you're afraid to make a mistake and you can trace it again with a Sharpie or just use the Sharpie by itself. The black marker really makes the design pop and creates an easy outline for kids to paint. This is just giving them a guide so they know where to paint. Painting over the lines is fine and you can tell parents to retrace the lines with a Sharpie at home once the paint is completely dry. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By adding the black and white design outline to each canvas, you are on your way to creating a professional-looking party with a little bit of extra preparation time. This step alone will go a long way in making the party day run more smoothly.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 5: Setting Up Your DIY Paint Party </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the day of the party, clear the place for your tables and cover the tables and/or floor with disposable table covers. Arrange the canvases flat on the table with the image facing up. If possible, allow about 12" between each canvas. You can also choose to buy medium-sized table easels. Of course, this adds to your party expense and isn't necessary. They take up about the same amount of space on the tables so think of easels more like decorations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set 2 paintbrushes on top of a paper towel next to each canvas. Fill the water cups or containers 3/4 of the way full with water and put them towards the center of the table. If you don't have enough for each kid to have their own water cup, 2 kids can share one cup. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add a small drop of each paint color to the paper plates. Again, you can use one plate per child, or 2 kids can share a plate. You can easily add more paint if they need more during the party. Make sure the paint is not in direct sunlight. You may even want to do this after all the kids arrive just to make sure none of the paint starts to dry out before the kids start painting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before painting, have the kids turn the canvas over and write their names on the back where the canvas covers one of the wooden stretcher bars by the staples (not in the center of the canvas). Use a pencil or marker. This step is important in case someone forgets which painting is theirs when it is time to take them home! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let the kids know that acrylic or tempera paint is best used with a <strong>dry</strong> brush. If too much water is added, the paint will become runny and transparent. In order to keep the colors as vibrant as possible, show them how to wash their brushes in the water cup each time they want to use a new color. "Scrubbing" the brush gently on the bottom of the cup is the best way to get a majority of the paint out. Just dipping the paintbrush into the water isn't going to do anything except start a watery mess. Paying attention to how each kid uses the paint and water will be a big help in managing the mess. Instruct them to dry their paintbrush on the paper towel as much as possible before using the brush with a new color.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Encourage kids to paint the sides of the canvas and cover all of the front with paint. Leaving white spots can attract dust and dirt once they are dry. Let the kids be creative with where to use each color. The paintings don't all have to look the same even though the kids are painting the same design! Again, remind them that it's ok to paint over the lines because a parent can help them to re-draw them in a day or two when the paint is completely dry. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 6: Clean Up </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have found that parties tend to last about 2 hours. Have the painting supplies and tables ready so you can paint as soon as all the guests show up. This will allow for as much drying time as possible before the kids take their paintings home. When it looks like all the kids are done painting, you can start to quickly clean up and move on to the next party activity. A general timeline is to paint for 30-45 minutes. Some kids will only be interested in painting for about 10 minutes which is why snacks can be helpful. I still try to encourage the kids to take their time and offer little suggestions for those who finish quickly (for example, ask them if they would like help painting the sides of the canvas or try to get them to come up with another place they could add some more paint). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When they are done, they can leave their supplies on the table and wash their hands and any paint off their arms in the bathroom. Then, I pull out the trash can and get to work. All the paper plates with paint and paper towels can go in the trash and the paintbrushes can be consolidated into one or two water cups. You can leave them bristle side down in the water cup to clean after the party is over. Dump out the rest of the water from the other cups and stack the cups to clean later. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since paint dries quickly (depending on the thickness, of course), find a sunny spot outside or under a window to lay the paintings to dry for the duration of the party. Use a new disposable table cover or transport the one from the table onto the floor or outside on a patio or deck. If you put the paintings outside, remember to secure the sides of the table cover with rocks or something else heavy so the plastic doesn't blow over on top of the paintings and get stuck to the wet paint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can use a fresh table cover to repurpose your tables for eating or opening presents. Use the rest of the party time to play games, have a dance party, swim, or eat! When it's time for your guests to leave, use a piece of cardboard or a plastic grocery bag to lay the canvas on top for transportation home. Remind the parents that parts of the paint may still be wet, but they can also put it out in the sunlight to dry more once they get home. Tell them about the option to retrace the black marker outline in a day or two after everything is dry. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Wrapping Up Your At-Home Art Party</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you found these tips helpful for creating your own art party at home. I have facilitated hundreds of parties and I am always met with enthusiastic children who can't believe the painting designs were "hand-drawn". I love to encourage kids that they can use art supplies just like adults can to create something they are proud to take home. Art parties don't have to be intimidating. Just have FUN!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also remember that while painting is a big part of the party, it doesn't have to take up the entire party time. If you're still hesitant to host the party at home, consider renting a park pavilion, neighborhood clubhouse, or even a room in a restaurant. If you plan ahead, the steps above will work no matter where you decide to have the party. Kids love parties and will remember painting with their friends and having a crazy dance party above anything else. If you can relax and have fun with it, they will too. Happy planning! </p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm so excited to talk about this subject! Homeschool art classes and projects are right up my alley as an artist and a homeschool mom myself. I know there is a ton of information out there with curriculum, print-outs, books and more, but today I just want to encourage you with a few simple ideas that you can easily do at home. Art doesn't have to be complicated (or even that messy). The most important part is to get your kids thinking creatively and using right-brain imagination and innovation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>COLOR!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my favorite things to start with is the color wheel. Most kids will happily use a box of crayons and some paper to scribble a few drawings, but thinking more intentionally about <em>why</em> they are using certain colors or discovering how colors interact with each other takes things to the next level. For example, complementary colors like blue and orange are high-contrast colors, yet they feel harmonious. In other words, they really grab your attention (so many sports team logos use complementary colors. Once you see it, you can't un-see it!). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or maybe they start noticing that colors next to each other on the color wheel (like blue-green and green) have a calming effect. You could then go into cool vs. warm colors or the fact that blue-green and green are called <strong>analogous</strong> colors on the color wheel (this is a fancy way of saying they are next to each other). Do an internet search for "color wheel" and you'll be on your way to discovering this and so much more about the colors around us. Printing and coloring their own wheel is a project in itself!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Combining Art With Other Subjects</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Art stimulates the right side of the brain, so why not do something to incorporate the left brain at the same time? By using the color wheel idea from above, you can effortlessly incorporate new vocabulary and spelling words (like tertiary, secondary, hue, and contrast). You can also take the color wheel (that they color) and have them glue or tape small items that match the colors to it from around the house. Buttons, colored paper clips, a section of a straw, or some pipe cleaners are just a few examples. I always try to use as many items that I already have at home first before rushing to buy something. Displaying their wheel somewhere prominent can lay the foundation for a year (or maybe even just a semester) of art at home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to incorporate art into other subjects is through creative writing. Use some starter questions to get their imagination flowing. What would it be like to be a crayon? Would you stay away from sunlight to avoid being melted? Would you get upset if your tip was broken? Maybe you would scream your best crayon scream to be picked from the box when you saw a new coloring book on the table. What would be your favorite thing to color? If you have a child who struggles with creative writing, these kinds of prompts can sometimes help even if you just talk about your answers. Of course, adding a coloring page or two to the story or turning it into a little pocket-sized book is a bonus win-win. </p>

<h2>Art Journaling</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take it a step further and talk about journaling. For some kids, a journal or sketchbook full of blank pages is too overwhelming. That's ok! Draw the color wheel for them (trace a cup or a bowl for a nice, neat circle) and have them color it. Or use a Sharpie and a ruler to draw a bunch of straight lines that overlap each other. Then, have them use crayons or colored pencils to color each section with a different color. It will end up looking like a stained glass window. They can pick whatever colors they want, or challenge them to use monochromatic colors (all the colors of a single hue). If they really enjoy that, use one page for each color on the color wheel and they'll end up with a book of rainbow-looking stained glass. They could even start at the top of the page with darker colors and end at the bottom with lighter colors for an ombre effect. There are so many possibilities!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to the journaling part! For more creative kids, let them decide how to use a few of their blank pages to describe how they are feeling that day. Maybe it's dark and rainy outside and they just want to scribble. Or maybe it's getting closer to the holidays (or their birthday) and they want to write and then decorate a colorful wish list. A stream of consciousness page is fun to get out all the things they are thinking about in a 10-minute period. Set a timer and have them write in different sizes and at different angles every word that comes to mind. This can be a very revealing project! If they seem to be experiencing some writer's block, give them a theme like naming as many ice cream toppings they can think of. As an added step, draw a giant ice cream cone and have them write the words inside the outline. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For older kids or teenagers, print an alphabetical chart in their favorite font and have them try to write the words in that script. Hand lettering is so much fun if you can get the hang of it. Handwriting in general is so important in this digital age and sometimes I feel like it's a lost art in and of itself! Getting them to write creatively in different colors and scripts along with creatively writing short stories can get them thinking differently and maybe even help in other areas like reading. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Mixed-Media Painting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you're ready to invest a little bit more into art supplies, consider buying a value pack of canvases, some craft paint, and an assortment of brushes and plastic palette knives. You could take one canvas and turn it into a lesson about mixing colors. Use a pencil or marker to write the color words from the color wheel (red, red-orange, orange, etc). Then have them paint swatches of color above each word and tell them they'll have to mix colors together to come up with the secondary and tertiary colors. If you plan to keep the canvas around for a while, consider painting it white first as a background layer so the canvas doesn't attract dirt and dust when you're done (canvases that are completely painted are easy to wipe down later). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another canvas could be used for a "free art day" where you give them some paint along with a bunch of other supplies like crayons, markers, colored pencils, or even chalk pastels. Let them experiment with the supplies to see what they like to use better. Maybe they even discover a few things like how marker over dry paint makes the colors pop out. You could even talk about the scientific properties of the different supplies and how the wax in the crayons reacts to water and watercolors. If you're not ready to buy a pack of canvases, look for an inexpensive pad of watercolor paper (or the thickest pad of regular sketch paper or art paper you can find) and have them draw first with crayons and then paint over it with watercolors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Painting with watercolors is also very calming, less expensive, and can be easier to clean up than paint. Make sure to instruct them to use a small amount of water to get richer colors that will be easier to see after it dries. Too much water will dilute the paint and may even make holes in the paper (I call them paper crumbs). Another idea with watercolors is to paint a piece of paper and then write a note to someone on it after it is dry. It's fun to write on such beautiful and colorful paper! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the easiest ways to experiment with watercolors is to combine them with table salt. This could get a little messy, so consider using a plastic or aluminum tray (or make your own out of foil). Paint a piece of paper with watercolors and throw some salt onto it before it dries. The salt crystals will create patterns in the paint and "grow" right before your eyes. Brush off the excess salt when the painting is dry and use some complementary colored pencils to outline the shapes the salt makes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Collages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my favorite go-to ideas (especially for a rainy day) is a good old-fashioned collage. This is a fun project if your child wants to decorate the front of their art journal. Use old magazines, coloring book pages, or even watercolor paper they painted themselves to tear or cut out words and pictures. You can use everyday white glue, or buy special collage glue. Sometimes the plain white glue can make the paper crinkle up when it dries. Try your best to smooth out the glue under the paper and use it again to paint a top coat of glue at the end when all the areas of the front of the journal are covered. This will give it a slightly glossy look and prevent any corners from tearing. Don't forget to overlap some of the pieces of paper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To combine more elements of creative writing and thinking, ask them to find words or phrases in the magazines that describe them. You can also print out a favorite quote or saying in a fancy font (be aware that sometimes home printer ink will smudge under too much glue). If they don't like the look of the white printer paper, have them color or paint the paper before gluing it. Some kids might like the super straight lines of using scissors to cut each piece, while others might like to tear them out for a more distressed edge. Allow them to make these decisions so they end up with a journal they are really proud of and look forward to using. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collages can also be done on regular paper, construction paper, cardstock, or poster board. Combine this with one of their interests like cooking or animals. If they really like to bake, create a few collage pages in their journal and have them write a recipe on an index card and paste it on top of the food collage. Again, the more you can combine their interests with art the better. They will stay engaged with the project and probably ask to do more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If they love a particular animal, create a collage page with all kinds of pictures of that animal. Then, have them write all the word associations they can think of on top of the pictures with a bold marker like a Sharpie. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Nature Art!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sticking with the journal concept, the next thing we'll talk about is taking all this wonderful art goodness OUTSIDE! Depending where you live will determine how and when you can do this. Use their journal pages (or a heavier book) to press some grass or small flowers. Glue them onto the journal pages when they are flat and dry. Older children who enjoy writing can take something they find outside and turn it into a small poem. You can also find writing prompts online or make up some of your own. No matter what they write about, writing in nature can be very therapeutic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another nature art idea is to find leaves or tie some pieces of grass to a stick to make a "nature brush". Experiment with different types of paint on the journal pages and then write or document the materials used. This could turn into a mini-science project if you can come up with a good hypothesis on which natural materials will work better with paint. Or have them collect some rainwater the next time it rains to use with their paint while talking about the water cycle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Landscape drawings can also be a fun way to remember certain days or keep track of the weather for a week. They could also draw the cloud formations for 5 days in a row and then write about which clouds produced rain (if any) along with the different types of clouds. Go even further by creating a journal page with cloud types using cotton balls. Color the page blue and then write a label for each cloud type (like cirrus, cumulonimbus, and cumulus). Try to create the different types by stretching and separating the cotton balls and gluing them under each label. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to nature art, there are too many ideas to list here. I'll leave you with one more for now; start a bug, leaf, or rock collection. Use the journal to draw what happens when the leaves dry or examine the rocks with a magnifying glass and draw some of the tiny crystals. Draw and label the bugs or name them and write a short story with a coloring page. If you can find a caterpillar, use it as an opportunity to draw and color the life cycle of a butterfly. We have also done this with moths. Again, tailor this to your child's interests for maximum impact!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>You Can Teach Art!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope I have given you some ideas on how to easily and inexpensively add art to your homeschool curriculum. Try not to overthink it or compare yourself to other families who may seemingly have a more robust art program. Remember that each household and child is different. What you may lack in artistic ability you will make up in other areas. The important thing is to allow your children to experiment and experience art a little bit at a time and as much as you can (with both your time and money). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you still need help teaching and introducing art to your kids, check out a few craft books or art history books from your local library. Show these to your kids and ask them to show you what parts of the books they are interested in. Maybe older kids will want to study a certain artist or try to recreate a famous painting. The possibilities are endless! After all, “You can’t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.” – Maya Angelou</p>
