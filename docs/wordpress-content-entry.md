What To Expect
```

**Content** (paste into WYSIWYG):

Party planning includes selecting a theme for canvas designs a week in advance of the party. I will create black and white outline designs ahead of time on each canvas for the kids to paint during the party. Upon arrival, I will set up tables with all of the art supplies (tables not included). Painting will take approximately 45-60 minutes. I will clean up all art supplies and prepare your tables for other activities of your choosing (food and drinks not included). If there is anything else I can do to assist during the party, just ask! I am here to help! Most parties only require access to trash cans and sinks.

### Main Content

**Section Title**:
```
Kids Art Lessons are Now Available!
```

**Description** (paste into WYSIWYG):
```
Art has been linked to many developmental benefits including improving fine motor skills and developing cognitive skills like how to plan, execute, and problem solve through a project. It also encourages decision making and self-expression and may even improve academic performance.

My goal is to encourage out-of-the-box thinking through hands-on art projects that will keep your child(ren) learning throughout the summer months. Creativity fosters imagination and expression through experimentation with a variety of materials.

With art lessons, I will provide private in-home one-on-one instruction on an individual basis and in small groups for children ages 4 and up. Art lesson sessions can be custom designed around the materials with which the child(ren) would like to work. I can also provide suggestions and ideas for fun projects.
```

**Pricing Text**:
```
Art lessons are available Monday-Friday. All supplies are included. A $25 non-refundable deposit is required at the time of scheduling.

The deposit will be applied to the total amount on the day of the session. Each session will last 2 hours.
```

**Features** (Repeater field — click "Add Row" for each):
1. `Individual Lessons: $45 (1 child)`
2. `Group Lessons: $30 per child (up to 10 children)`
3. `All Supplies Included`
4. `2-Hour Sessions`
5. `Available Monday-Friday`
